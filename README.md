# GPS-Tracking-Systems-

Our project is on GPS tracking system and monitoring peripherals for company vehicle. This is an IOT and WEB DEVELOPMENT project that helps us track the real time position and condition of vehicles. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite-based navigation system that consists of 24 orbiting satellites, each of which makes two circuits around the Earth every 24 hours. These satellites transmit three bits of information ‚Äì the satellite's number, its position in space, and the time the information is sent. These signals are picked up by the GPS receiver, which uses this information to calculate the distance between it and the GPS satellites.

With signals from three or more satellites, a GPS receiver can triangulate its location on the ground (i.e., longitude and latitude) from the known position of the satellites. With four or more satellites, a GPS receiver can determine a 3D position (i.e., latitude, longitude, and elevation). In addition, a GPS receiver can provide data on your speed and direction of travel. Anyone with a GPS receiver can access the system. Because GPS provides real-time, three-dimensional positioning, navigation, and timing 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, all over the world, it is used in numerous applications, including GIS data collection, surveying, and mapping.

Hence forth by using this technology we are able to locate the real time position of the vehicles that are dispatched for testing over the test tracks, by locating we mean not only the position or location of the vehicle but also the speed per Km according to time interval, gaining access over peripherals like engine, suspensions, fuel tank, brakes etc. help us gain more stability over the field of manufacturing vehicles.

This also insures safety for the vehicles that are on fields for testing and that the components are working fine. By doing this we not just save time but manufacture quality products to our customers.
